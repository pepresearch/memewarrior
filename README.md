# memewarrior
MemeWarrior is a python script which takes as input an image file and creates an altered copy of the image where each pixel is altered randomly in small amounts to make the new image indistinguishable from the original for human eyes but difficult for AI censors to catch.

# Installation
Make sure you have the latest version of Python installed. You can download Python at https://www.python.org/.<br />
Make sure you have the latest version of PIP installed. You can download PIP at https://pypi.org/project/pip/.<br />
<br />
If you have an up to date operating system then Python should already be installed.<br />
<br />
Execute the following command:<br />
<code>
  pip install pillow
</code>

# Running
To run on Windows<br />
Drag and Drop an image file onto "memewarrior.bat"<br />

To run on Mac<br />
Drag and Drop an image file onto "memewarrior.scpt"<br />

<b>Example:</b> If you have an image called <code>&lt;some directory&gt;/kek.jpg</code> then drag and drop it onto the appropriate file (see above) and it will create a new image file called <code>&lt;some directory&gt;/kek_me.jpg</code>.
