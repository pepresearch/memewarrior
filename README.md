# memewarrior
MemeWarrior is a python script which takes as input an image file and creates an altered copy of the image where each pixel is altered randomly in small amounts to make the new image indistinguishable from the original for human eyes but difficult for AI censors to catch.

To run on Windows
Drag and Drop an image file onto "memewarrior.bat"

To run on Mac
Drag and Drop an image file onto "memewarrior.sh"
